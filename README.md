# Look Ma' without loops!

This is a sample project used as a reference for an [article](https://dev.to/chrisvasqm/look-ma-without-loops-3fff) I wrote on how to complete a challenge
without using `for`/`while`/`for-each` loops that we commonly learn when we first start coding.

## Challenge instructions

> Find the the amount of people that are above and below the average out of all the students's scores in a subject that are stored inside of an array.
